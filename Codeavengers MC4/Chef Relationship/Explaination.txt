Lets take an example and go on:

given word: avengers
firstly count the repetations of each character:

{'a': 1,'v': 1, 'e': 2, 'n': 1, 'g': 1, 'r': 1, 's': 1}

given duplicates: aaaaaavvvvvvveeeeennnnnnnnngggeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrsss
now count the repetation of each character: 

{'a1': 6, 'v1': 7, 'e1': 11, 'n1': 9, 'g1': 3, 'r1':15 , 's1': 3}

now the solution is:

minimum(a1/a,v1/v,e1/e,n1/n,g1/g,r1/r,s1/s) since we can only make a word if all letters are possible
for a number of times.

In order to find that we need to find the min element from above.
