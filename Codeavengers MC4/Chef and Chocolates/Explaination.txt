In order to find number of ASTERISKS you can use the following formula:

	= n+(n/2)(n/2+1)

and then you can get the value of R.

Suppose for above case R=11 and mentioned that 1rs --> 1 chocolate and 3 wrappers --> 1 chocolate
So we have 
           11 ruppees --> 11 chocolates --> 11 chocolate covers
  11 chocolate covers -->  3 chocolates -->  5 chocolate covers (11-9+3)
   5 chocolate covers -->  1 chocolate  -->  3 chocolate covers (5-3+1)
   3 chocolate covers -->  1 chocolate  -->  1 chocolate covers (3-3+1)

Total = 16 chocolates
