For this question you can directly go with Priority Scheduling Algorithm.

Suppose the ministers who meet the chef be the processes and the time they spend with chef
be the burst time of each process. 

so Waiting time of process = Waiting time of before process + burst time of before process
-> Waiting time of minister = Waiting time of before minister + time spend with chef by before minister

so  Actual time in minutes= (7*60 + waiting time of minister)/60:(7*60 + waiting time of minister)%60
