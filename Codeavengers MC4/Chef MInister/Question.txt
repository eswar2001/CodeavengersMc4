Sample Input:

	1
	3
	2 10
	1 20
	3 30
	1

Sample Output:

	07:20
	
EXPLANATION:

First the person with priority 1 entered the office and came out after 20 min of his meeting
Therefore his entry time is 07:00
Second the person with priority 2 entered the office and came out after 10 min of his meeting
Therefore his entry time is 07:20
Finally the person with priority 3 entered the office and came out after 30 min of his meeting
Therefore his entry time is 07:30

Since we want the entry time of First person in the List that is the person with 2nd priority.
So his entry time is 07:20
