Here you need to find the number of bits which are fliping in each increment.
So in order to find that you can XOR the values.
for eg:

	10^11: 1010 ^ 1011 = 0001= number of bits flipped= count(setbits)
	so in each case you need to XOR the values and then count their number of bits
	and add them then you can get some value.
for the result find its binary number and find the no of set bits and find whether they are even or odd.
