Chef and Competition

Chef has attended a contest conducted by Codechef Student Chapter, VIIT where he got an interesting program to solve.
Now your task is to help the chef to solve that question. If chef wins the contest then you will get a party from chef.
He needs to find the number K  ie. K is the total number of flips those bits made to increment from $0$ to $N-1$.
So chef need to find the number of set bits in K is weather even or odd for the given values of N
Help the chef to complete the above problem and enjoy the party from the chef.

Input:

- First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- The first line of each test case contains single integer N. 

Output:

- For each test case, print a single line Even or Odd.

Constraints: 
- 1 <= T <= 10^9
- 2 <= N <= 10^9

Sample Input:

    1
    10

Sample Output:

    Odd
	
EXPLANATION:

    Value  Flips in each increment
    0000
    0001    -    1
    0010    -    2
    0011    -    1
    0100    -    3
    0101    -    1
    0110    -    2
    0111    -    1
    1000    -    4
    1001    -    1
               ----
                16  :  10000  
    No of set bits = Odd
