Each number in segment display takes the following segements:

0 - 6 segments
1 - 2 segments
2 - 5 segments
3 - 5 segments
4 - 4 segments
5 - 5 segments
6 - 6 segments
7 - 3 segments
8 - 7 segments
9 - 6 segments

so for example the number be i) 123
	
	total segments = 2+5+5 = 12
	since the maximum number shoud be with more digits we use the number using smallest segments
	
	so 1 and 7 are smallest. Therfore if the segements count is even we can directly print one's
	else ie. ODD we can print 7 and followed by ones, the reason is we use 2 segements to make 1 
	which is even and 3 segments to make 7 which is odd.

	Answer = 111111 --> (12/2 no of one's)
similarly : ii) 333
	
	total segments = 15
	
	Answer = 7111111

   	7		111111
	15-3 = 12	12/2 = 6 ,so the answer is 7111111
