Chef has a Watch which is gifted by his friend.It is a digital watch.
So the numbers in watch are Seven Segment display.

Now you have a given a number N. You have to find the maximum number K that can be generated using the segments used in that number,  
i.e if you have given the 123 then in seven segment display number of segments for 1 is 2,
similarly for 2 it is 5 and 3 it is 5. So totally there are 12 segments.
By using these 12 segments the maximum number that can be generated is 111111.

Input:

- First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- The first line of each test case contains single integer N. 

Output:
- For each test case, print the largest possible number K

Constraints: 
- 1 <= T      <= 100
- 2 <= len(N) <= 100

Sample Input:
    1
    123

Sample Output:
111111
